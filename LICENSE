 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free software license that guarantees end users the
 freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. This general public license
 applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
 whose authors commit to using it. (Some other software is covered by the GNU Lesser
 General Public License instead.)

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
 Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies
 of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
 or can get it if you want it, and that you can change the software and use pieces of it
 in new free programs.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
 restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of
 the software, or if you modify it.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,
 you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make
 sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
 terms so they know their rights.

 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you
 this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
 software.

 For the developers' and authors' sake, the GPL ensures that everyone else is also
 treated fairly.  For example, if you distribute copies of the software, you must pass on
 the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that everyone else also
 receives or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know
 their rights.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid
 the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses,
 in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
 any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

 If you have any questions about this license or the software, please contact the Free
 Software Foundation.
